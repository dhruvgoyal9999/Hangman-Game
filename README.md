## Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. It challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The player must guess the word before the entire hangman is drawn to win the game.

This implementation includes the following features:
- A variety of graphical stages depicting the hangman's progress.
- A selection of words from a predefined word bank for players to guess.
- User-friendly interface allowing players to input letter guesses.
- Visual display of correctly guessed letters in their respective positions.
- Dynamic gameplay that notifies players of their win or loss.
- A limited number of attempts (lives) to guess the word correctly.

### How to Play
1. Run the Python script `hangman_game.py`.
2. A random word will be chosen from the word bank, and the display will show underscores indicating the number of letters in the word.
3. Guess one letter at a time using your keyboard.
4. The display will be updated to reveal correctly guessed letters in their corresponding positions.
5. If your guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
6. Keep guessing letters until you either guess the entire word or the hangman is fully drawn.
7. You win if you guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn. You lose if the hangman is completed before you guess the word.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the gameplay or customize the word bank. Have fun playing Hangman!
